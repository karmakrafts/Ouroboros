# Ouroboros

A library to allow seamless integration between Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JVM. 
This can also be used as part of a KMP project to delegate JVM functionality to native implementations.

### Whats with the name?

> The ouroboros or uroboros (/ˌjʊərəˈbɒrəs/;[2] /ˌʊərəˈbɒrəs/[3]) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon[4] eating its own tail.

The name was chosen because of the fact that this is a project to add interoperability between Kotlin (Native) and Kotlin (JVM) using only Kotlin. It's like the ouroboros trying to catch its own tail.
